You are currently plugged into the Neovim text editor on a user's machine.\n\nYour core tasks include:\n- Answering general programming questions.\n- Explaining how the code in a Neovim buffer works.\n- Reviewing the selected code from a Neovim buffer.\n- Generating unit tests for the selected code.\n- Proposing fixes for problems in the selected code.\n- Scaffolding code for a new workspace.\n- Finding relevant code to the user's query.\n- Proposing fixes for test failures.\n- Answering questions about Neovim.\n- Running tools.\n\nYou must:\n- Follow the user's requirements carefully and to the letter.\n- Keep your answers short and impersonal, especially if the user's context is outside your core tasks.\n- Minimize additional prose unless clarification is needed.\n- Use Markdown formatting in your answers.\n- Include the programming language name at the start of each Markdown code block.\n- Avoid including line numbers in code blocks.\n- Avoid wrapping the whole response in triple backticks.\n- Only return code that's directly relevant to the task at hand. You may omit code that isnâ€™t necessary for the solution.\n- Avoid using H1, H2 or H3 headers in your responses as these are reserved for the user.\n- Use actual line breaks in your responses; only use \"\\n\" when you want a literal backslash followed by 'n'.\n- All non-code text responses must be written in the English language indicated.\n- Multiple, different tools can be called as part of the same response.\n\nWhen given a task:\n1. Think step-by-step and, unless the user requests otherwise or the task is very simple, describe your plan in detailed pseudocode.\n2. Output the final code in a single code block, ensuring that only relevant code is included.\n3. End your response with a short suggestion for the next user turn that directly supports continuing the conversation.\n4. Provide exactly one complete reply per conversation turn.\n5. If necessary, execute multiple tools in a single turn.","cycle":1,"opts":{"visible":false,"tag":"from_config"}},{"role":"user","id":82286830,"content":"Here is the content from the file located at `app/lib/hooks/use-window-scroll.ts`:\n\n```nil\nimport { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from \"react\";\n\ninterface Position {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n}\n\ninterface Args {\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called when the window scroll position changes.\n   * **NOTE**: You should memoize this callback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n   */\n  onScroll?: (pos: Position) => void;\n  /**\n   * Callback that is called when the window scroll position stops changing.\n   * **NOTE**: You should memoize this callback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n   */\n  onScrollEnd?: (pos: Position) => void;\n}\n\n/**\n * A hook that tracks window scroll position, with some optional callbacks\n * */\nexport function useWindowScroll({ onScroll, onScrollEnd }: Args = {}) {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n\n  const updatePosition = useCallback((onUpdate?: (pos: Position) => void) => {\n    const pos: Position = { x: window.scrollX, y: window.scrollY };\n    setPosition(pos);\n    onUpdate?.(pos);\n  }, []);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleScroll = () => {\n      updatePosition(onScroll);\n    };\n\n    handleScroll();\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", handleScroll, { passive: true });\n    return () => window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", handleScroll);\n  }, [onScroll, updatePosition]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleScrollEnd = () => {\n      updatePosition(onScrollEnd);\n    };\n\n    handleScrollEnd();\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"scrollend\", handleScrollEnd, { passive: true });\n    return () => window.removeEventListener(\"scrollend\", handleScrollEnd);\n  }, [onScrollEnd, updatePosition]);\n\n  return {\n    x: position.x,\n    y: position.y\n  };\n}\n\n```","cycle":1,"opts":{"visible":false,"reference":"<file>app/lib/hooks/use-window-scroll.ts</file>"}},{"role":"user","id":753485994,"content":"Can you review this code?

Relying on it will not work cross-browser; in Chrome, it's experimental behind a flag.\n   - To detect scroll end, you generally need to use a debounced timeout after `\"scroll\"` events.\n2. Initial position is set via `handleScroll()` and `handleScrollEnd()` calls at effect mount, which is fine, but redundant (both do the same thing on mount).\n3. There's no cleanup for the timeout if `\"scrollend\"` is to be simulated manually.\n4. Only `window` scroll is tracked (not a problem if that's the intent).\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- Replace the `\"scrollend\"` event with a debounced handler.\n- Clean up debounce on unmount to prevent memory leaks.\n- Optionally, remove duplicate initial update.\n\n**Suggested Next Turn:**\nWould you like a code fix to correctly handle scroll end using debounce?","cycle":1,"opts":{"visible":true}},{"role":"user","id":239866137,"content":"What would like your improved version look like?","cycle":2,"opts":{"visible":true}},{"role":"llm","id":2049058526,"content":"Pseudocode for improvement:\n- Combine initial position set into a single effect.\n- Replace `\"scrollend\"` listener with a debounced function triggered by `\"scroll\"`.\n- Clean up timeout on unmount.\n- Still call `onScroll` and (after debounce) `onScrollEnd`.\n\nTypeScript\n\nimport { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n\ninterface Position {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n}\n\ninterface Args {\n  onScroll?: (pos: Position) => void;\n  onScrollEnd?: (pos: Position) => void;\n  /** Time (ms) to wait after last scroll before calling onScrollEnd (default: 150) */\n  scrollEndDelay?: number;\n}\n\nexport function useWindowScroll({ onScroll, onScrollEnd, scrollEndDelay = 150 }: Args = {}) {\n  const [position, setPosition] = useState<Position>({ x: 0, y: 0 });\n  const scrollEndTimeout = useRef<number | null>(null);\n\n  const updatePosition = useCallback((onUpdate?: (pos: Position) => void) => {\n    const pos: Position = { x: window.scrollX, y: window.scrollY };\n    setPosition(pos);\n    onUpdate?.(pos);\n  }, []);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const handleScroll = () => {\n      updatePosition(onScroll);\n\n      if (scrollEndTimeout.current) {\n        window.clearTimeout(scrollEndTimeout.current);\n      }\n      if (onScrollEnd) {\n        scrollEndTimeout.current = window.setTimeout(() => {\n          updatePosition(onScrollEnd);\n        }, scrollEndDelay);\n      }\n    };\n\n    // Set initial position\n    updatePosition();\n\n    window.addEventListener(\"scroll\", handleScroll, { passive: true });\n    return () => {\n      window.removeEventListener(\"scroll\", handleScroll);\n      if (scrollEndTimeout.current) {\n        window.clearTimeout(scrollEndTimeout.current);\n      }\n    };\n  }, [onScroll, onScrollEnd, scrollEndDelay, updatePosition]);\n\n  return {\n    x: position.x,\n    y: position.y\n  };\n}\n\nWould you like to see test code for this hook?","cycle":2,"opts":{"visible":true}}],"schemas":[],"save_id":"1746722117","in_use":[],"settings":{"top_p":1,"temperature":1,"frequency_penalty":0,"presence_penalty":0,"model":"gpt-4.1"},"updated_at":1746722259,"cycle":3,"refs":[{"path":"/Users/nbr/repos/dealercenter-digital/bc-web-client-poc/frontend/app/lib/hooks/use-window-scroll.ts","id":"<file>app/lib/hooks/use-window-scroll.ts</file>","opts":{"watched":false,"visible":true,"pinned":false},"source":"codecompanion.strategies.chat.slash_commands.file"}]}
