# nibru.vim

This is my personal **Neovim** config on which I am working on from time to time, while learning about the whole universe of **VIM**.

The config is based on Neovim Nightly (Version: >0.5xx) and Treesitter for improved Syntax Highlighting.

## Todo

- [ ] Convert to NeoVim native LSP
- [ ] Convert to LUA
- [ ] Research Scss auto-completion/LSP
