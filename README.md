# nibru.nvim

This is my personal [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) config on which I am working on from time to time, while learning about the whole universe of [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) and [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).

The config is based on [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) Nightly (Version: >0.5xx) and Treesitter for improved Syntax Highlighting, and is completely written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
