# nibru.vim

This is my personal **Neovim** config on which I am working on from time to time, while learning about the whole universe of **VIM**.

The config is based on Neovim Nightly (Version: >0.5xx) and Treesitter for improved Syntax Highlighting.

## Todo

- [ ] Convert to NeoVim native LSP
- [ ] Convert to LUA
- [ ] Research Scss auto-completion/LSP
- [x] Split maps 

### Lazygit

- [ ] Configure edit with editor
- [ ] Setup config files for CLI and VimPlugin
  - [CLI](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/blob/master/docs/Config.md)
  - [VimPlugin](https://github.com/kdheepak/lazygit.nvim)
