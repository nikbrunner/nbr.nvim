💬:
Can you write me a little script based on `gum` to choose a `npm` script from `package.json`
All it should do, when run is to make a selectable list when inside of a repository wit ha `package.json` and then after the pick run the `npm` command

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I'll help you create a script that uses `gum` (the charming CLI tool) to select and run npm scripts from package.json.

Here's a shell script that does exactly that:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names from package.json and format them for gum
scripts=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json)

# If no scripts found
if [ -z "$scripts" ]; then
    echo "No scripts found in package.json!"
    exit 1
fi

# Use gum choose to select a script
selected=$(echo "$scripts" | gum choose --header="Select an npm script to run:")

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

To use this:

1. Save it as something like `npm-pick` or `run-script`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x npm-pick`
3. Place it somewhere in your PATH (like `/usr/local/bin/` or `~/bin/`)

The script:
1. Checks if there's a package.json in the current directory
2. Uses `jq` to extract all script names from package.json
3. Pipes these scripts to `gum choose` with a header
4. Runs the selected script using `npm run`

Requirements:
- `gum` installed (`brew install gum` on macOS)
- `jq` installed (`brew install jq` on macOS)

When you run it, you'll get a nice interactive list of all your npm scripts, and when you select one, it'll run immediately.

Would you like me to explain any part in more detail or suggest any enhancements?


💬:
Okay this works, but what would be simpler is to use `fzf` for this instead of gum

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah yes, `fzf` is a great choice for this - it's more widely available and can be even simpler. Here's the modified version:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe directly to fzf
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:')

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

This version is more concise and only requires `jq` and `fzf`. The main advantages:
- Fewer lines of code
- `fzf` provides fuzzy finding out of the box
- No need for intermediate variables
- Works with standard terminal keybindings that many users are familiar with

Requirements:
- `fzf` installed (`brew install fzf` on macOS)
- `jq` installed (`brew install jq` on macOS)

Save it, make it executable (`chmod +x`), and you're good to go! Would you like any modifications to the script?


💬:
What would be a great 2 or 3 letter name for this tool?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Here are some intuitive 2-3 letter names for the script:

2 letters:
- `nr` (npm run)
- `ns` (npm select)
- `np` (npm pick)

3 letters:
- `nps` (npm pick script)
- `npr` (npm pick run)
- `nrs` (npm run select)

I'd personally recommend `nr` as it's:
1. Super short
2. Intuitive (matches the "npm run" concept)
3. Easy to type
4. Not likely to conflict with other common commands

Would you like me to suggest more options or explain the


💬:
Pretty cool. I chose `nr`. 

Would it be somehow possible to sort these by usages?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes! We can track script usage by storing the count in a file (like `~/.nr_history`) and sort based on that. Here's the enhanced version:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HISTORY_FILE="$HOME/.nr_history"

# Create history file if it doesn't exist
touch "$HISTORY_FILE"

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Get scripts and their usage counts, sort by count (descending), and format for display
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | while read script; do
    count=$(grep -c "^$script$" "$HISTORY_FILE" || echo 0)
    echo "$count $script"
done | sort -rn | cut -d' ' -f2- | fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:')

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it and log it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    echo "$selected" >> "$HISTORY_FILE"
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

This script:
1. Maintains a history file at `~/.nr_history`
2. For each script, counts how many times it appears in the history
3. Sorts scripts by usage count (most used first)
4. When a script is run, adds it to the history

The history is a simple text file with one script name per line. The more you use a script, the higher it will appear in the list.

Want me to suggest any refinements to this approach?


💬:

Although it is working, we skip the usage count for now.

But would it be possible to preview the script itself for each line?

<script-key> | <script-value> ?

I have the following from /Users/nbr/.scripts/nsr:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe directly to fzf
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:')

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes! We can modify the script to show a preview of the script command using `fzf`'s preview window. Here's the enhanced version:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe to fzf with preview window showing the script command
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | \
    fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:' \
        --preview 'jq -r ".scripts.\"{}\"" package.json' \
        --preview-window=right:50%)

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

This version:
1. Uses `fzf`'s `--preview` option to show the script command
2. The preview command uses `jq` to lookup the script value for the currently selected key
3. Sets the preview window to the right side taking 50% of the space

Now when you move through the script list, you'll see what each script actually does in the preview window.

Want me to adjust the preview window size or add any other enhancements?


💬:

Not working. I just displays `null` on the right side

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, the issue is with the jq command escaping. Here's the corrected version:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe to fzf with preview window showing the script command
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | \
    fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:' \
        --preview 'jq -r ".scripts.[\"{}\""]" package.json' \
        --preview-window=right:50%)

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

The key change is in the preview command. Instead of using `\"{}\"`, we use `.[\"{}\""]` which is the correct way to access the property in jq.

This should now properly show the script command in the preview window. Let me know if you need any adjustments!


💬:

Now it says zsh:1 unmatched "

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, we need to handle the quotes properly. Here's the fixed version:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe to fzf with preview window showing the script command
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | \
    fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:' \
        --preview 'jq -r ".scripts.[\"{}\""]" < package.json' \
        --preview-window=right:50%)

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

Or alternatively, we can use single quotes for the outer command and double quotes for the inner one:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe to fzf with preview window showing the script command
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | \
    fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:' \
        --preview 'jq -r ".scripts.\"{}\"" package.json' \
        --preview-window=right:50%)

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"
fi
```

One of these should work now. Let me know if you're still seeing any issues!


💬:
This doesnt work. Lets try something else for now. What I want to achieve is to trigger this via a mapping.

How can I bind the command `nsr` in my zshrc to ctrl+n ?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
To bind `nsr` to Ctrl+N in your `.zshrc`, you can add this line:

```bash
bindkey -s '^N' 'nsr\n'
```

Break down:
- `bindkey -s` is used to bind a key to a string
- `^N` represents Ctrl+N
- `'nsr\n'` is the command to execute (the `\n` adds the newline, so it executes immediately)

Add this line to your `.zshrc`, then either:
- Restart your terminal
- Or run `source ~/.zshrc`

The binding should now be active. Pressing Ctrl+N will execute `nsr` as if you had typed it and pressed enter.

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, I see the issue. You're trying to run `npm run nsr` but `nsr` is actually your script selector tool. You should run `nsr` directly since it's already in your PATH (


💬:
You have broken up

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Let me complete that thought.

The error occurs because you're trying to run `npm run nsr`, but `nsr` is your script selector tool, not an npm script. 

There are two issues to fix:

1. You should run `nsr` directly, not as `npm run nsr`
2. In your script, you removed the `npm run` part from the execution line. Let's fix that:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe directly to fzf
selecte


💬:
You keep breaking up during your response

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Let me provide the complete response in one go:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if package.json exists
if [ ! -f "package.json" ]; then
    echo "No package.json found in current directory!"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract script names and pipe directly to fzf
selected=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | fzf --header='Select an npm script to run:')

# If a script was selected (user didn't cancel), run it
if [ ! -z "$selected" ]; then
    npm run "$selected"    # <- This line was missing 'npm run'
fi
```

To use this:
1. Make sure the script is executable (`chmod +x /Users/nbr/.scripts/nsr`)
2. Run it directly as `nsr`, not as `npm run nsr`
3. For the keyboard shortcut in `.zshrc`, keep the line:
   ```bash
   bindkey -s '^N' 'nsr\n'
   ```

This should now work correctly. Let me know if you need any clarification!


💬:
No that was not my intention i want to use like that, but i probably did something wrong. What I want to achieve now is to trigger this via a binding.

because sometimes i need to combin things

First I write `npm run ` manually and then press `C-n` to select a script
```
npm run <C-t>
```

I select a script and on enter it gets placed

```
npm run dev:something
```

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, now I understand! You want to use `fzf` as an interactive script selector that inserts the selected script name at your cursor position, rather than executing it immediately. Here's how to modify your setup:

In your `.zshrc`:
```bash
# Function to select npm script
function _select_npm_script() {
  SCRIPT=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | fzf --header='Select an npm script:')
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT}"
  zle reset-prompt
}

# Create a new widget from the function
zle -N _select_npm_script

# Bind it to Ctrl+N
bindkey '^N' _select_npm_script
```

This will:
1. Create a function that gets the script name from package.json using fzf
2. Insert the selected script name at the current cursor position
3. Bind it to Ctrl+N

Now you can:
1. Type `npm run `
2. Press Ctrl+N
3. Select a script
4. The script name will be inserted at your cursor position
5. Press Enter to execute

This gives you the flexibility to modify the command before executing it or combine it with other commands.


💬:

It works, but what is `zle`?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
`zle` stands for "Zsh Line Editor" - it's the component in Zsh that handles command line editing and input.

When we use `zle`:
- `zle -N _select_npm_script` creates a new Zsh widget (an interactive command line function) from our shell function
- `LBUFFER` is a special ZLE variable that represents everything to the left of the cursor
- `zle reset-prompt` refreshes the command line display after we modify it

This is part of Zsh's powerful line editing system that allows us to:
1. Create custom widgets (functions)
2. Manipulate the command line programmatically
3. Bind these widgets to keyboard shortcuts
4. Integrate with the command line editing interface

Without `zle`, we couldn't modify the command line contents interactively - it's what makes the dynamic script insertion possible rather than just executing commands.

Would you like me to explain more about what other things you can do with `zle`?


💬:
No so far, but what I think would be good is to place a white space after each entry, so i dont have to press space everytime i want to append something

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes, we can modify the function to automatically add a space after the selected script. Here's the updated version:

```bash
# Function to select npm script
function _select_npm_script() {
  SCRIPT=$(jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json | fzf --header='Select an npm script:')
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "  # Note the added space after ${SCRIPT}
  zle reset-prompt
}

zle -N _select_npm_script
bindkey '^N' _select_npm_script
```

The only change is adding a space in the string concatenation: `${SCRIPT} ` instead of just `${SCRIPT}`.

Now when you select a script, it will automatically add a space after it, making it easier to add additional arguments or continue typing.


💬:

Okay this is pretty cool. Could we also populate the choices with previous `npm` commands i already ran? When I press <C-r> i have access to these

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes! We can combine both the scripts from package.json and your command history filtered for npm commands. Here's how:

```bash
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history
  SCRIPT=$(
    {
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
      # Get npm commands from history
      fc -l -


💬:
You have broken up again

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Here's the complete solution:

```bash
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history
  SCRIPT=$(
    {
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
      # Get npm commands from history, filter for 'npm run', remove duplicates
      fc -ln 1 | grep "npm run" | sed 's/npm run //' | sort -u
    } | fzf --header='Select an npm script:' | tr -d '\n'
  )
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "
  zle reset-prompt
}

zle -N _select_npm_script
bindkey '^N' _select_npm_script
```

This script:
1. Gets scripts from package.json if it exists
2. Gets npm commands from your shell history using `fc -ln 1`
3. Filters for "npm run" commands
4. Removes the "npm run" prefix using sed
5. Removes duplicates with `sort -u`
6. Combines both sources and pipes to fzf

Now you'll see both package.json scripts and your previously used npm commands in the selection list.


💬:
This is working great. It would make sense though to prioritze the commands from the history higher up

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
We can modify the script to show history items first by using `sort -r` to reverse sort. Here's the updated version:

```bash
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history
  SCRIPT=$(
    {
      # Get npm commands from history first, filter for 'npm run', remove duplicates
      fc -ln 1 | grep "npm run" | sed 's/npm run //' | sort -u
      echo "-------------------"  # Add a separator
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
    } | fzf --header='Select an npm script:' --separator="-------------------" | tr -d '\n'
  )
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "
  zle reset-prompt
}

zle -N _select_npm_script
bindkey '^N' _select_npm_script
```

Changes made:
1. Reordered to show history items first
2. Added a separator line between history and package.json scripts
3. Added `--separator` flag to fzf to properly handle the visual separation

Now your most recently used commands will appear at the top, followed by a separator line, and then all available scripts from package.json below.


💬:
Okay this is working awesomely. Can you also attach these flags to the fzf call?

I have the following from repo-runner/fzf.go:

```go
	// Define the color scheme (See tmux manual for --color)
	colorComponents := []string{
		"fg:white",
		"fg+:yellow",
		"bg+:-1",
		"gutter:-1",
		"hl+:magenta",
		"border:yellow",

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Here's your script updated with those fzf styling options:

```zsh
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Define color scheme
  local color_scheme="fg:white,fg+:yellow,bg+:-1,gutter:-1,hl+:magenta,border:yellow,prompt:cyan,pointer:yellow,marker:cyan,spinner:green,header:blue,label:yellow,query:magenta"

  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history

      # Get npm commands from history first, filter for 'npm run', remove duplicates
      fc -ln 1 | grep "npm run" | sed 's/npm run //' | sort -u
      echo "-------------------"  # Add a separator
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
    } | fzf \
        --reverse \
        --no-separator \
        --no-info \
        --no-scrollbar \
        --border=bold \
        --border-label="┃ npm scripts ┃" \
        --border-label-pos=3 \
        --prompt="❯ " \
        --padding="1,5" \
        --color="$color_scheme" \
        --header='Select an npm script:' \
        --separator="-------------------" \
        | tr -d '\n'
  )
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "
  zle reset-prompt
}
```

This incorporates all the styling from your Go code, including:
- The color scheme
- Border styling
- Layout options (reverse, no separator, no scrollbar)
- Padding and positioning
- Custom prompt and border label

I changed the border label to "npm scripts" to match the context. Let me know if you'd like to adjust any of the visual elements!

Awesome. One last thing. The entries from the history should include its `npm run` since this was already sometime a valid entry.

The key change is removing the `sed 's/npm run //'` part from the history command pipeline. Now the history entries will show the full command including `npm run`. Let me know if you'd like any other adjustments!


💬:
Awesome. What would be a good mapping instead of C-n? which does not conflict with the default mappings from fzf? 
It should be with control though, not alt

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Common Ctrl key combinations that are typically safe and don't conflict with fzf's default bindings include:

- `^R` (already used by history search)
- `^T` (already used by file search)
- `^G` (git files)
- `^S` (often used for forward search)
- `^P` (often used for previous)

Some good options that are usually free and make semantic sense for npm scripts:

1. `^J` (for "JavaScript")
2. `^L` (for "List")
3. `^K` (commonly available)
4. `^Y` (usually free)

I would personally recommend `^J` because:
1. It's semantically related (JavaScript/Node)
2. It's easy to reach
3. It's rarely used by other tools
4. It's not part of fzf's default bindings

To change it, just update the bindkey line:
```zsh
bindkey '^J' _select_npm_script  # Ctrl+J
```

Would you like me to suggest more alternatives?


💬:

Okay thats fine thank you.

One last thing. Could add headers to the two sections?

Previously ran scripts -----
- ...
- ...
- ...
Scripts from package.json ----
- ...
- ...
- ...

With better formatting of course

I have the following from /Users/nbr/.zshrc:

```zsh
# Function to select npm script
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Define color scheme
  local color_scheme="fg:white,fg+:yellow,bg+:-1,gutter:-1,hl+:magenta,border:yellow,prompt:cyan,pointer:yellow,marker:cyan,spinner:green,header:blue,label:yellow,query:magenta"

  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history
  SCRIPT=$(
    {
      # Get npm commands from history first, filter for 'npm run', remove duplicates
      fc -ln 1 | grep "npm run" | sort -u
      echo "-------------------"  # Add a separator
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
    } | fzf \
        --reverse \
        --no-separator \
        --no-info \
        --no-scrollbar \
        --border=bold \
        --border-label="┃ npm scripts ┃" \
        --border-label-pos=3 \
        --prompt="❯ " \
        --padding="1,5" \
        --color="$color_scheme" \
        --header='Select an npm script:' \
        --separator="-------------------" \
        | tr -d '\n'
  )
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "
  zle reset-prompt
}
```

Here's the updated version with formatted section headers:

```zsh
function _select_npm_script() {
  # Define color scheme
  local color_scheme="fg:white,fg+:yellow,bg+:-1,gutter:-1,hl+:magenta,border:yellow,prompt:cyan,pointer:yellow,marker:cyan,spinner:green,header:blue,label:yellow,query:magenta"

  # Combine package.json scripts and npm command history
  SCRIPT=$(
    {
      echo "═══ Previously Run Scripts ═══"
      # Get npm commands from history first, filter for 'npm run', remove duplicates
      fc -ln 1 | grep "npm run" | sort -u
      echo "═══ Package.json Scripts ═══"
      # Get scripts from package.json if it exists
      [ -f package.json ] && jq -r '.scripts | keys | .[]' package.json
    } | fzf \
        --reverse \
        --no-separator \
        --no-info \
        --no-scrollbar \
        --border=bold \
        --border-label="┃ npm scripts ┃" \
        --border-label-pos=3 \
        --prompt="❯ " \
        --padding="1,5" \
        --color="$color_scheme" \
        --header='Select an npm script:' \
        | tr -d '\n'
  )
  LBUFFER="${LBUFFER}${SCRIPT} "
  zle reset-prompt
}
```

Changes made:
1. Removed the simple separator
2. Added formatted headers using `═══` for visual separation
3. Removed the `--separator` flag since we're using headers now

The headers will appear as:
```
═══ Previously Run Scripts ═══
[history entries here]
═══ Package.json Scripts ═══
[package.json scripts here]
```

Let me know if you'd like to try different formatting for the headers!
