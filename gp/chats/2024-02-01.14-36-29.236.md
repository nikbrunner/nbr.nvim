Write your queries after ðŸ—¨:. Use `<C-g><C-g>` or :GpChatRespond to generate a response.
Response generation can be terminated by using `<C-g>s` or :GpChatStop command.
Chats are saved automatically. To delete this chat, use `<C-g>d` or :GpChatDelete.
Be cautious of very long chats. Start a fresh chat by using `<C-g>c` or :GpChatNew.

Certainly! The code you provided is mapping over the `activeAdvertisers` array and checking a condition for each `advertiser`. If that condition is true, it returns the `advertiser`; otherwise, it returns `null`. We can shorter this by using a ternary operator directly inside the `map()` function, making the code more concise.

Here's a rewritten shorter version of your code snippet using ES6 arrow functions and the ternary operator:

```ts
const possibleAdvertisers: (ProductDetailsAdvertiser | null)[] = activeAdvertisers.map(
  advertiser => advertiserMap[advertiser]() ? advertiser : null
);
```

This refactored code does exactly the same as your original code but in a more succinct way. The ternary operator checks the condition `advertiserMap[advertiser]()` and returns `advertiser` if it's true, or `null` otherwise, directly inside the map callback.
````ts
      const possibleAdvertisers: (ProductDetailsAdvertiser | null)[] = activeAdvertisers.map(advertiser => {
        if (advertiserMap[advertiser]()) {
          return advertiser;
        } else {
          return null;
        }
      });
      ```

is there a shorter way to write this?
