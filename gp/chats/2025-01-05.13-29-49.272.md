I have the following from nbr.keymap/README.md:

```markdown
# nbr.keymap

A scope-based keymap system for modal editors that organizes mappings based on their contextual scope rather than by tool or function.

## Philosophy

Traditional modal editor keymaps typically organize bindings by tool (git, LSP, etc.) or function.

This system takes a different approach by organizing mappings based on their scope of operation:

```
<Scope><?Group><Operation>
```

- **Workspace** (`<leader>w`) - Operations affecting the entire workspace
- **Document** (`<leader>d`) - Operations on the current document
- **Symbol** (`<leader>s`) - Operations on code symbols
- **Hunks** (`<leader>h`) - Operations on code chunks/hunks
- **App** (`<leader>a`) - Application-level operations

## Design Principles

1. **Scope First**:

- Every operation must clearly belong to a specific scope (workspace, document, symbol)
- The scope should be immediately obvious from the operation's nature
- Operations affecting multiple scopes should be carefully considered

2. **Semantic Operations**:

- Mappings should represent clear, meaningful operations
- Focus on frequently used operations that benefit from quick access
- Operations should be distinct from basic editor commands
- Focus on what the operation means, not how it's implemented

3. **Tool & Editor Agnostic**:

- Mappings should be independent of specific tools or editors
- Use semantic terms (e.g., 'version' instead of 'git')
- Implementation details are left to the user's configuration

4. **Preserve Editor Defaults**:

- Don't replace basic editor operations with custom mappings
- Focus on operations that enhance rather than replace core functionality
- Leave common editor commands in their traditional form

5. **Consistent Patterns**:

- Second key should relate to the action within the scope
- Related operations should share the same scope
- Maintain predictable patterns across all mappings

6. **Single Source**:

- Each operation should have exactly one mapping
- Avoid duplicate mappings across different key combinations
- Choose the most appropriate and efficient mapping location

## Open Questions

- What about plugin related keymaps, which are sort of "extra" and do not belong in one of the categories?
  - For example `file-surfer.nvim` is not really a workspace switcher. Its just provides extra functionality to quick find a file in another workspace
  - Should we put it into `<leader>ad` to find a document in another workspace? It seems fitting, but this is only possible in Neovim

## Leader Key

I personally use (and recommend) `,` as my leader key, but you can use any key you like.
This way we use both hands in combination when typing the keymaps, which reduces strain by balancing the workload on the fingers.
Also I find that the the middle finger is faster than the thumb, which is generally a good thing, but also very nice to quickly double tap the leader key, to reach the command mode.

## Keymap

### `<leader><leader>` - Global

This is a little bit of a special case, as it's not really a keymap, but a global command.
This is an alternative way to quickly enter the command mode (same as `:`), which lends to increased direct usage of the builtin commands without mapping them.

Since I am using home row mods (really bottom row mods.. See my layout [here](https://github.com/nikbrunner/koyo>), I sometimes get missfires for quickly typing `:`.
When quickly dobule tapping the leader key, I quickly and safely reach the command mode, without worrying about typos.

This is of course just personal preference.

### `<leader>a` - App

## Introduction

**kōyō** is a sleek, minimalistic keyboard layout, designed with a 36-key split configuration. Its name is inspired by the harmony and elegance of Japanese aesthetics and the calming feeling of autumn leaves.

> In Japanese, **kōyō (紅葉)** translates to "autumn leaves" and is used to describe the phenomenon of leaves changing color in the autumn season. The word is composed of two kanji characters: **kō (紅)** meaning "crimson" and **yō (葉)** meaning "leaf".

## Note

> [!NOTE]
> The layout in its current form is mainly focused for use in combination with MacOS.
> It can work on other operating systems, but the layout may not be optimized for them.
> In the future, I (hopefully) will be working on optimizing the layout for other operating systems.

## Features

### Core Layout

- QWERTY Base: Familiar layout to ease the transition while maintaining efficiency
- Compact 36-Key Design: Optimized for minimal finger movement and maximum ergonomics
- Strategic Alpha Placement: Bottom row alphas remain easily accessible without blocking home row access

### Layer Design

- Extended layer under space bar for frequently used tools
- Dual symbol layers (one per hand) with semantic arrangement
- Dedicated number and function key layers

### Thumb Cluster Philosophy

- Reserved for high-frequency, single-action keys (Space, Enter, Tab)
- Dual-purpose modifiers (MEH, HYPER) integrated with common actions
- Avoids sequential/repeated actions to prevent thumb fatigue
    - e.g. Backspace implemented as two-finger combo (I+O) to avoid repeated presses of thumb

### Navigation & Tools

- Vim-Inspired Navigation:
    - Arrow keys in familiar HJKL pattern
    - Navigation shortcuts following vim metaphors
        - `[` & `]` for often used navigation bindings are combos on the base layer
    - Extended layer provides quick access to common movements
- Efficient Symbol Access:
    - Symbols arranged in semantic pairs for intuitive access
    - Common programming symbols placed at strongest fingers
    - Consistent access pattern across both hands

### Special Features

- Integrated Shortcuts:
    - Quick access to common GUI commands
        - e.g. Put common GUI commands on left hand split to enable one hand use in combination with the right hand on mouse
    - Tab and window management controls
    - Media and system controls in dedicated layer
- Smart Tap Dancing:
    - Dual-function keys for extended capabilities
    - Context-aware modifier combinations
    - Reduced finger travel for common operations

### Quality of Life

- Achordion Integration: Smart handling of hold-tap actions
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Works seamlessly across operating systems
- Customizable Function Layer: Easy access to F-keys and system functions

I am looking for naming suggestions.
I have this cool keymap project `nbr.keymap` and my qmk layout repository called `koyo`. I am very happy with the name `koyo` and I am very fond of Japan in general.

I am looking for an alternative name for `nbr.keymap`. I dont want to inject my initials on it (nbr). I would rather look for another fitting japanese  name/word for it. 

Take the inspiration i wrote out in the koyo file and maybe you have a good idea for the name of my keymap project. :)

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Based on the philosophy and design principles of your keymap system, and keeping with the Japanese theme, here are some thoughtful suggestions:

1. **秩序** (chitsujo) - meaning "order, organization, discipline"
   - Reflects your systematic approach to organizing keymaps by scope
   - Emphasizes the structured and disciplined nature of your system

2. **道** (michi) - meaning "way, path, journey"
   - Similar to concepts like "do" in martial arts (judo, kendo)
   - Represents a systematic approach or philosophy
   - Could be stylized as "michi.keymap"

3. **配列** (hairetsu) - meaning "arrangement, sequence"
   - Directly relates to the organization of keys
   - Represents the thoughtful arrangement of your system

4. **調和** (chōwa) - meaning "harmony, balance"
   - Reflects how your system brings harmony to keyboard mappings
   - Complements kōyō's aesthetic philosophy

5. **整理** (seiri) - meaning "organization, arrangement, putting in order"
   - Similar to the concept of "5S" in Japanese business philosophy
   - Emphasizes the organizational aspects of your system

Given that kōyō (紅葉) represents natural harmony and beauty, I would particularly recommend **調和** (chōwa) as it:
- Maintains the Japanese aesthetic connection
- Uses the same pattern of having a long ō vowel like kōyō
- Represents the harmonious organization of your keymap system
- Philosophically aligns with your goal of creating balance and order in keyboard mappings

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these suggestions or explore other options?


💬:
What do you think about Kanso?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, **簡素** (kanso) is an excellent choice! Let me explain why it would be particularly fitting for your keymap project:

Kanso (簡素) represents simplicity, plainness, and the elimination of clutter - it's one of the seven principles of Zen aesthetics. This aligns perfectly with your keymap system because:

1. **Design Philosophy Match**
- Your keymap system emphasizes clarity and organization
- It removes unnecessary complexity by organizing bindings by scope
- It follows clear, consistent patterns
- It aims to be clean and minimal in its approach

2. **Conceptual Alignment**
- Kanso emphasizes that beauty and usefulness needn't be overstated
- Your system similarly focuses on practical, clear organization without unnecessary complications
- The principle of "less is more" is evident in your scope-based approach

3. **Aesthetic Continuity**
- Like kōyō, it's a Japanese aesthetic concept
- It maintains the Japanese theme while representing a complementary principle
- Both names reflect different aspects of Japanese philosophical beauty

4. **Technical Relevance**
- Kanso's principle of "elimination of the non-essential" matches your keymap's focus on:
  - Single source of truth for mappings
  - Clear scope definitions
  - Avoiding duplicate mappings
  - Focus on semantic operations

I think `kanso` would be an excellent name that both reflects the system's philosophy and pairs beautifully with `koyo`. They would feel like two related projects sharing a common aesthetic and philosophical foundation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspects of kanso's meaning or its relationship to your project?


💬:
Yes I think so too. Could you please write me a introductory chapter for my readme about this?

🤖:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Here's a draft for your README introduction that explains the meaning and significance of "kanso":

```markdown
# kanso (簡素)

A scope-based keymap system that brings simplicity and clarity to modal editor configurations through mindful organization and purposeful design.

## Introduction

**Kanso** (簡素) represents one of the seven principles of Zen aesthetics, embodying simplicity, plainness, and the elimination of clutter. It teaches that beauty and utility emerge from the absence of the non-essential—a philosophy perfectly aligned with this keymap system's approach to organization.

Just as kanso advocates for thoughtful reduction to reveal essential beauty, this keymap system organizes mappings based on their contextual scope rather than by tool or function. The result is a clear, intuitive structure that enhances both understanding and usage.

The system categorizes operations into distinct scopes (Workspace, Document, Symbol, etc.), creating a predictable and efficient pattern that reduces cognitive load while maintaining full functionality. This approach mirrors kanso's principle that true efficiency and elegance come from careful organization and the removal of unnecessary complexity.

Like its sister project [kōyō](https://github.com/nikbrunner/koyo)—a minimalistic keyboard layout named after the seasonal beauty of autumn leaves—kanso aims to bring harmony and purpose to your editing experience through mindful design and careful consideration of user needs.
```

Would you like me to adjust any aspects of this introduction? I can also help expand it with more specific connections between the kanso principle and your system's design principles.
