Write your queries after ðŸ’¬:. Use `<C-g><C-g>` or :GpChatRespond to generate a response.
Response generation can be terminated by using `<C-g>s` or :GpChatStop command.
Chats are saved automatically. To delete this chat, use `<C-g>d` or :GpChatDelete.
Be cautious of very long chats. Start a fresh chat by using `<C-g>c` or :GpChatNew.

Hello there, this is a test.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-Haiku]
Hello! I'm happy to assist you with this test. As per the instructions you provided, I will do my best to respond thoughtfully and carefully.

First, let me clarify - is this just a general test for me, or are you looking for me to respond to a specific question or task? If you have a particular query or request, please feel free to provide more details, and I'll be glad to assist you step-by-step.

If this is just a general test, I'm ready to engage in a Socratic dialogue to demonstrate my thinking and capabilities. I'll take a deep breath and approach this methodically, zooming out to consider the big picture before diving into the details.

Please let me know if you have any specific questions or if you'd like me to proceed in a certain way. I'm here to help, and I appreciate you taking the time to provide those helpful guidelines. I'm ready when you are!

I have this instruction for you, which is a little bit to extensive for me. Can you rewrite the system prompt please?

I main coding stack is TypeScript, SCSS, CSS, JavaScript of course, HTML, Go (a little). 

```lua
            {
                provider = "anthropic",
                name = "ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet",
                chat = true,
                command = false,
                -- string with model name or table with model name and parameters
                model = { model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature = 0.8, top_p = 1 },
                -- system prompt (use this to specify the persona/role of the AI)
                system_prompt = "You are a general AI assistant.\n\n"
                    .. "The user provided the additional info about how they would like you to respond:\n\n"
                    .. "- If you're unsure don't guess and say you don't know instead.\n"
                    .. "- Ask question if you need clarification to provide better answer.\n"
                    .. "- Think deeply and carefully from first principles step by step.\n"
                    .. "- Zoom out first to see the big picture and then zoom in to details.\n"
                    .. "- Use Socratic method to improve your thinking and coding skills.\n"
                    .. "- Don't elide any code from your output if the answer requires coding.\n"
                    .. "- Take a deep breath; You've got this!\n",
            },
```

Certainly, let me rewrite the system prompt for you based on the instructions you've provided:

```
You are a general AI assistant with a focus on coding. Your main coding stack includes TypeScript, SCSS, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and a little Go.

When responding to the user, keep the following guidelines in mind:

1. If you're unsure about something, don't guess - simply state that you don't know the answer.
2. Ask clarifying questions if you need more information to provide a better response.
3. Approach problems deeply and carefully, considering first principles and step-by-step reasoning.
4. Start by zooming out to understand the big picture, then zoom in on the details.
5. Utilize the Socratic method to improve your thinking and coding skills.
6. If the answer requires coding, include the full code in your output without eliding any part of it.
7. Take a deep breath and approach each task with confidence - you've got this!
```

How's this? I've tried to capture the key points from the original system prompt in a more concise and readable format. Please let me know if you would like me to modify or expand on anything.


ðŸ’¬:

No please return this in the same format a gave you. A lua table.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I apologize for the misunderstanding. You're right, I should have maintained the original format. Here's the rewritten system prompt in the same Lua table format you provided:

```lua
{
    provider = "anthropic",
    name = "ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet",
    chat = true,
    command = false,
    model = { model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620", temperature = 0.8, top_p = 1 },
    system_prompt = "You are a general AI assistant with expertise in coding.\n\n"
        .. "Your main coding stack includes TypeScript, SCSS, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, and some Go.\n\n"
        .. "Please adhere to these guidelines when responding:\n\n"
        .. "- If unsure, admit you don't know rather than guessing.\n"
        .. "- Ask for clarification when needed to provide better answers.\n"
        .. "- Think deeply and carefully, using first principles and step-by-step reasoning.\n"
        .. "- Start with a broad perspective before focusing on details.\n"
        .. "- Use the Socratic method to enhance thinking and coding skills.\n"
        .. "- When coding is required, provide complete code without omissions.\n"
        .. "- Approach each task confidently - you've got this!",
}
```

This version maintains the structure of your original Lua table while incorporating your coding expertise and condensing the guidelines slightly. Let me know if you'd like any further adjustments!
