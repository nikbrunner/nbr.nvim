```bash
formatted_input="Convert this task description into a concise English branch name. If the description contains a issue number like 'bcd-xxxx', please include it in the branch name. The end result should be lowercase and should look something like this: '<bcd-xxxx>/<summary>'.: $input"
```

Can you convert this to a multiline string? This is bash. I don't know how to do that.

🤖:[ChatGPT4]
Certainly! In Bash, a multiline string can be created using a Here Document (heredoc) or by using double quotes with newlines included. Given that you have a string that contains code and instructions, let's proceed with the heredoc approach since it will also handle quotes within your original string without needing to escape them.

Here's an example of how you would convert the string in the variable `formatted_input` into a multiline string using a heredoc:

```bash
read -r -d '' formatted_input << 'EOF'
Convert this task description into a concise English branch name. If the description contains a issue number like 'bcd-xxxx', please include it in the branch name. The end result should be lowercase and should look something like this: '<bcd-xxxx>/<summary>'.: $input
EOF
```

The above Bash snippet sets `formatted_input` to a multiline string. `<< 'EOF'` indicates the start of the heredoc, which will continue until the `EOF` delimiter is reached on its own line with no leading tabs or spaces.

Please note that `-r` in `read` prevents backslashes from acting as escape characters, and `-d ''` tells `read` to continue until it encounters the `EOF` delimiter instead of newline which is the default delimiter for `read`. The inner quotes around `EOF` ensure that the contents are treated as a literal string without any variable expansion or command substitution.

Would you like to understand more about how this works or anything else to add?


🗨:
does this declare formatted_input as a global variable?
is this not also solvable with `cat`?

🤖:[ChatGPT4]
Yes, the provided snippet declares `formatted_input` as a global variable in the shell script. The `read` command populates the variable with the contents between the `<< 'EOF'` heredoc delimiter and the closing `EOF`.

The same effect can also be achieved with `cat`, which might be easier to use or understand for some users. Here's an example using `cat`:

```bash
formatted_input=$(cat <<'EOF'
Convert this task description into a concise English branch name. If the description contains a issue number like 'bcd-xxxx', please include it in the branch name. The end result should be lowercase and should look something like this: '<bcd-xxxx>/<summary>'.: $input
EOF
)
```

This uses command substitution `$()` to capture the output of the `cat` command, which is fed a heredoc as input. Just like the previous approach, using `<<'EOF'` ensures that the heredoc is treated literally, with no parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion.

Both methods achieve the same result with slightly different syntax, and both declare `formatted_input` as a global variable, unless they are contained inside a function where `formatted_input` would then be local to that function.

Please let me know if you need further explanation or help with another task.

❯ git smart-branch Button „Zum Vergleich“ führt zum Merkzettel statt zum Vergleich : BCD-6730
fatal: 'It seems you have not provided me with a task description to convert to a branch name. Could you please share the specific task description?' is not a valid branch name

The problem is that $input does not get replaced with the input. I think this is because the input is not in the same scope as the variable. How can I fix this?

This is what i currently have: 
```bash

# Format the input for GPT-4
formatted_input=$(
    cat <<'EOF'
Convert this task description into a concise English branch name. 
If the description contains a issue number like 'bcd-xxxx', please include it in the branch name. 
The end result should be lowercase and should look something like this: '<bcd-xxxx>/<summary>'.: $input
EOF
)
```

🤖:[ChatGPT4]
The heredoc syntax with single quotes (`<<'EOF'`) won't expand shell variables like `$input`. You need to use double quotes (`<<"EOF"`) if you want variable expansion within the heredoc.

Here's the revised Bash snippet where `$input` will be correctly replaced with the value of the `input` variable:

```bash
input="Button „Zum Vergleich“ führt zum Merkzettel statt zum Vergleich : BCD-6730" # Assuming this is your input from somewhere in the script

# Format the input for GPT-4
formatted_input=$(
    cat <<"EOF"
Convert this task description into a concise English branch name. 
If the description contains an issue number like 'bcd-xxxx', please include it in the branch name. 
The end result should be lowercase and should look something like this: '<bcd-xxxx>/<summary>'.: $input
EOF
)

echo "$formatted_input"
```

This will expand `$input` within the heredoc. However, to address your real need, which seems to be creating a branch name from an input description, you do not actually need to include the large prompt text. Instead, you can parse the `input` directly.

Here is a function to create a proper branch name which includes the task number and summarizes the input task into a slug:

```bash
create_branch_name() {
    input=$1
    task_number=$(echo "$input" | grep -oE 'BCD-[0-9]+') # Extracts the task number if present
    task_summary=$(echo "$input" | sed -E 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9]+/-/g' | sed -E 's/-BCD-[0-9]+//g' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]') # Creates a URL-friendly summary
    task_summary=$(echo "$task_summary" | cut -c 1-50) # Truncate summary if it's very long
    echo "${task_number}/${task_summary}"
}

branch_name=$(create_branch_name "Button „Zum Vergleich“ führt zum Merkzettel statt zum Vergleich
