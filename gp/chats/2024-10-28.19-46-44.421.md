Can you please help me with the fix? Do you understand what I am trying to do? What the problem is?
Ask to clarify if you need more information.

I have the following from bc-desktop-client/src/client/commons/libs/queries/use-settings.ts:

```typescript
        setToolSettings({
          ...values,
          meta: {
            // Fix: If a user visits the settings page for the first time, it gets set to `meta.viewedSettings: true`
            // But when he presses the save button, the `meta.viewedSettings` inside of `values.meta` is still `false`
            ...values.meta,
            touchedSettings: true
          }
        });
```

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I see you're working with a tool settings management system, and there seems to be an issue with maintaining the state of `viewedSettings` when saving the form.

From your comment, it appears that:
1. When a user first visits the settings page, `viewedSettings` is set to `true` (this happens in the `useOnMount` hook at the bottom of the code)
2. However, when the user saves the form, this value is getting lost because `values.meta` still has the initial state where `viewedSettings` was `false`

To fix this, you should preserve both the `viewedSettings` and set `touchedSettings` to true. Here's how you could modify the code:

```typescript
setToolSettings({
  ...values,
  meta: {
    ...values.meta,
    viewedSettings: true, // Preserve the viewed state
    touchedSettings: true // Mark as touched
  }
});
```

Before I provide additional suggestions, could you confirm:
1. Is this the specific issue you're trying to fix?
2. Should `viewedSettings` always be true when saving, or should we preserve its current value from the existing toolSettings?
3. Are there any other metadata fields we need to consider preserving?

This would help me provide a more targeted solution. Also, it might be helpful to see how the `toolSettings` type is defined (the `TS` generic type that extends `ToolSetting`).


ðŸ’¬:

Yeah this is right, but I am trying to avoid just setting both flags in that place. This would fix the issue,
but I assume that `...values.meta` would already contain `meta.viewedSettings: true`. 

I assume that the `useFormik` hook got initialized with the `meta.viewedSettings` value of `false` and is stuck on that.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, now I understand better! Yes, you're correct - this is a Formik initialization issue. 

The problem occurs because:
1. When the page loads, `useOnMount` sets `viewedSettings: true` via `setToolSettings`
2. However, Formik was already initialized with the initial values where `viewedSettings` was `false`
3. Unless Formik reinitializes, it keeps those initial values

There are a few ways to fix this:

1. Use `enableReinitialize: true` in Formik options to pick up the new values after the initial `setToolSettings`. However, you already have a conditional `enableReinitialize` that depends on `hasSubmitted`:
```typescript
enableReinitialize: hasSubmitted && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
```

2. Wait for the initial `viewedSettings` update before initializing Formik. You could do this by:
```typescript
const [isInitialized, setIsInitialized] = useState(false);

useOnMount(() => {
  if (!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings) {
    setToolSettings({
      ...toolSettings,
      meta: {
        ...toolSettings.meta,
        viewedSettings: true
      }
    }).then(() => setIsInitialized(true));
  } else {
    setIsInitialized(true);
  }
});

const formik = isInitialized ? useFormik<TS>({
  // ... rest of your formik config
}) : null;
```

3. Change the `enableReinitialize` condition to also reinitialize when the settings are first loaded:
```typescript
enableReinitialize: (hasSubmitted || !toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings) && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
```

Which approach would you prefer? I think option 3 might be the simplest solution, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.


ðŸ’¬:

The rule of hooks that they conditionally calling a hook is not allowed

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah yes, you're absolutely right - I apologize for suggesting conditional hook usage which violates the Rules of Hooks. That would be a mistake.

Let's look at better solutions:

1. We could modify the `enableReinitialize` condition to handle the initial state:
```typescript
enableReinitialize: (!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings || hasSubmitted) && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
```

2. Or, we could handle this in the `initialValues` function by ensuring we start with the correct `viewedSettings` value:
```typescript
initialValues: options.formik?.initialValues?.(toolSettings) ?? {
  ...toolSettings,
  meta: {
    ...toolSettings.meta,
    viewedSettings: true // Force this to be true in initial values
  }
},
```

I think option 1 is cleaner because:
1. It allows Formik to properly reinitialize when the `viewedSettings` flag is updated
2. It maintains the existing pattern of using `enableReinitialize`
3. It's more explicit about when we want the form to reinitialize

Would you like to try this approach? Or do you see any potential issues with this solution?


ðŸ’¬:
enableReinitialize does also reinitialize the initialValues?

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Yes, exactly! When `enableReinitialize` is true and the `initialValues` prop/parameter changes, Formik will reinitialize the form with the new initial values.

So in this case, the flow would be:
1. First render: Formik initializes with `toolSettings` where `viewedSettings` is `false`
2. `useOnMount` runs and calls `setToolSettings` to set `viewedSettings` to `true`
3. This triggers a re-render with new `toolSettings`
4. Because `enableReinitialize` would be `true` (since `!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings` was true), Formik will reinitialize with the new values where `viewedSettings` is `true`

This is why modifying the `enableReinitialize` condition should fix the issue. The form will pick up the new `viewedSettings` value after it's set by `useOnMount`.

Would you like to try this solution? We can monitor if it properly updates the form values when `viewedSettings` changes.


ðŸ’¬:

I have the following from bc-desktop-client/src/client/commons/libs/queries/use-settings.ts:

```typescript
    enableReinitialize:
      (!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings || hasSubmitted) && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
```


I tried this, but it doesn't work.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Let's debug this. The issue might be in the timing or the conditions. Could you help me understand:

1. Can you confirm what you're seeing? For example:
   - Is `toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings` changing as expected?
   - Is `enableReinitialize` ever evaluating to true?
   - Are the form values staying stale?

2. Could you add some console.logs to track the state changes:

```typescript
console.log({
  viewedSettings: toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings,
  hasSubmitted,
  isFetching: settings.isFetching,
  isPending: setSettings.isPending,
  enableReinitialize: (!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings || hasSubmitted) && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
  currentFormValues: formik.values
});
```

This would help us understand:
- When reinitialize is triggered
- What the current state is
- If the conditions are evaluating as expected

Could you share what you observe with these logs? This would help us identify where exactly the logic is failing.


ðŸ’¬:
This are the last logs, when I first open the settings page, without doing anything:

```
{
    "viewedSettings": true,
    "hasSubmitted": false,
    "isFetching": false,
    "isPending": false,
    "enableReinitialize": false,
    "currentFormValues": {
        "meta": {
            "toolVisible": false,
            "pinRequired": false,
            "touchedSettings": false,
            "viewedSettings": false,
            "highlighted": false
        }
    }
}
```

This is the last log after submit:

```
{
    "viewedSettings": false,
    "hasSubmitted": true,
    "isFetching": false,
    "isPending": false,
    "enableReinitialize": true,
    "currentFormValues": {
        "meta": {
            "toolVisible": true,
            "pinRequired": false,
            "touchedSettings": true,
            "viewedSettings": false,
            "highlighted": false
        }
    }
}
```

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah, now I see the issue more clearly:

1. When you first open the page:
   - `toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings` is already `true` (probably from a previous update)
   - But `formik.values.meta.viewedSettings` is `false`
   - `enableReinitialize` is `false` because `!toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings` is `false` and `hasSubmitted` is `false`

2. After submit:
   - `viewedSettings` in the log is showing `false` - this suggests we're looking at the form values rather than the actual toolSettings
   - `hasSubmitted` is `true`
   - `enableReinitialize` is `true`, but we're still not getting the correct values

It seems we might be looking at the wrong source for `viewedSettings` in our condition. Let's try to modify the code to ensure we're comparing against the correct values:

```typescript
const formik = useFormik<TS>({
  enableReinitialize: true,  // Let's try always reinitializing first to debug
  initialValues: options.formik?.initialValues?.(toolSettings) ?? {
    ...toolSettings,
    meta: {
      ...toolSettings.meta,
      viewedSettings: toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings  // Explicitly use the toolSettings value
    }
  },
  // ... rest of the config
});
```

Could you try this approach first? This way we ensure the form always starts with the correct `viewedSettings` value from `toolSettings`. 

If this works, we can then add back the conditional reinitialization with the correct conditions.

Let me know if you'd like to try this or if you'd prefer a different approach.


ðŸ’¬:

Setting `enableReinitialize` to `true` works in the way that the form values will contain the correct values for `viewedSettings`. However it brings alot of other issues. I made this conditional for a reason.

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
Ah yes, I apologize - you're right. Having `enableReinitialize` always true can cause issues like:
- Unwanted form resets
- Performance issues from constant reinitializations
- Potential loss of user input

Could you help me understand:
1. What were the specific issues you encountered that led to making `enableReinitialize` conditional?
2. What's the intended behavior for when the form should reinitialize?
3. Why is it currently conditioned on `hasSubmitted && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending`?

This would help us find a solution that fixes the `viewedSettings` issue while maintaining the important constraints you've put in place.

Maybe we need to look at a different approach altogether, like:
- Handling this in the `initialValues` function
- Modifying how we track the `viewedSettings` state
- Or adjusting when/how we update this flag

What are your thoughts on this?


ðŸ’¬:

Well the form should reinitalize with fresh inital values after the user `hasSubmitted`
And it should reinitalize when the mutation or query finished fetching (assuming new data). 
At least that was my thinking

ðŸ¤–:[ChatClaude-3-5-Sonnet]
I understand now. So the form should only reinitialize:
1. After a successful submission to get fresh values
2. When queries/mutations complete to get updated data
3. But we want to preserve user input during normal form interaction

And our current issue is that we need to somehow get the correct `viewedSettings` value into the form's initial state, without relying on reinitialization.

Since the `viewedSettings` flag is set in `useOnMount`, perhaps we should ensure this happens before Formik initialization? We could try:

1. Move the `viewedSettings` update logic to happen earlier, maybe using a ref to track if we've already set it:
```typescript
const viewedSettingsInitialized = useRef(false);

// Update viewedSettings before Formik initialization if needed
if (!viewedSettingsInitialized.current && !toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings) {
  setToolSettings({
    ...toolSettings,
    meta: {
      ...toolSettings.meta,
      viewedSettings: true
    }
  });
  viewedSettingsInitialized.current = true;
}

const formik = useFormik<TS>({
  enableReinitialize: hasSubmitted && !settings.isFetching && !setSettings.isPending,
  // ... rest of config
});
```

Or 2. Handle this in the initialValues function:
```typescript
initialValues: options.formik?.initialValues?.(toolSettings) ?? {
  ...toolSettings,
  meta: {
    ...toolSettings.meta,
    viewedSettings: toolSettings.meta.viewedSettings || true  // Force true in initial state
  }
},
```

Would either of these approaches work better with your existing constraints? Or do you see issues with these approaches?
