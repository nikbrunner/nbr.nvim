```ts
      const possibleAdvertisers: ProductDetailsAdvertiser[] = activeAdvertisers
        .map(advertiser => {
          if (advertiserMap[advertiser]()) {
            return advertiser;
          } else {
            return null;
          }
        })
        // remove all null values
        .filter(advertiser => advertiser !== null);
```

TypeScript complains here that this could contain nulls. But i am removing them. So what is the problem?

🤖:[ChatGPT4]
The TypeScript error message you've received indicates that the final type of `possibleAdvertisers` is being understood as an array of `(ProductDetailsAdvertiser | null)[]`, although you expect it to be `ProductDetailsAdvertiser[]` after filtering out the `null` values. 

The TypeScript type checker doesn't narrow the type that comes out of the `.map()` method based on the runtime check inside the `.filter()` method that follows. This is because TypeScript's static type system doesn't have the capability to carry through that kind of runtime check to alter the type inference.

What you can do to fix this issue is to use a type guard. A type guard is a function that tells TypeScript whether a certain variable is of a specified type. In your case, you want to define a predicate function that checks whether each item is not `null`, and as such can be considered a `ProductDetailsAdvertiser`.

Here is how you would typically implement this:

```ts
const possibleAdvertisers = activeAdvertisers
  .map(advertiser => {
    return advertiserMap[advertiser] ? advertiser : null;
  })
  // use a type guard to filter non-null values
  .filter((advertiser): advertiser is ProductDetailsAdvertiser => advertiser !== null);
```

Note the type guard in use here: `advertiser is ProductDetailsAdvertiser`. This tells TypeScript that the function passed to `.filter()` will return `true` if and only if `advertiser` is not `null`, and thus is a `ProductDetailsAdvertiser`. 

Since we are guarding against `null`, the `filter` now assures TypeScript that no `null` values will be in the resulting array, and thus the type of `possibleAdvertisers` becomes `ProductDetailsAdvertiser[]` as intended.

You don't necessarily need to write a named function to act as a type guard. Instead, you specify the type predicate directly in the lambda function given to the `filter`, inline within the code. If you did want to have a standalone function as your guard, you could implement it like so:

```ts
function isNotNull<T>(value: T | null): value is T {
  return value !== null;
}

// ...within your code

const possibleAdvertisers = activeAdvertisers
  .map(advertiser => {
    return advertiserMap[advertiser] ? advertiser : null;
  })
  // use the standalone type guard to filter non-null values
  .filter(isNotNull);
```

With either approach, the output `possibleAdvertisers` array will correctly be typed as `ProductDetailsAdvertiser[]`.
