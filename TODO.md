### Sessions

I like sessions, but i still don't have a workflow that suits me fully.

Either the sessions are to be managed via Neovim or I can also do that via TMUX.

**Requirements**

- Save, Load and Delete sessions
  - **Bonus** Depending on Git Branch
- Hooks 
  - Close all open Toggle Term processes on leave
- Changes `cwd`
  - But I am not sure who is responsible for these things..

#### Neovim

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/vvaw1x/which_in_your_opinion_is_the_best_session) is a reddit discussion about neovim session managers.
