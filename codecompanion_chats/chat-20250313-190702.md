Hello again

## CodeCompanion (Anthropic)

### Reasoning

The user has just sent a simple greeting "Hello again". This appears to be a casual opening greeting rather than a specific programming task. I should respond briefly and helpfully, while keeping my response short and professional.

I'll acknowledge their greeting and indicate I'm ready to help with any programming, code, or Neovim-related tasks they might have.

### Response

Hello! I'm CodeCompanion, your programming assistant for Neovim. How can I help you today with:

- Code explanations or reviews
- Programming questions
- Test generation
- Code scaffolding
- Neovim assistance

What would you like to work on?
